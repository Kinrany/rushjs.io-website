## 3 minute demo

Want to see Rush in action?  The only prerequisite you need is [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node).

**From your shell, install Rush like this:**
```sh
$ npm install -g @microsoft/rush
```

(Don't type the **"$"** of course.)  :-)

**For command-line help, do this:**
```sh
$ rush -h
```

**To see Rush build some real projects, try running these commands:**
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack
$ cd rushstack
$ rush install
$ rush update  # <-- instantaneous!
$ rush rebuild
$ rush build    # <-- instantaneous!
```

_(If you don't have a GitHub account set up, you can use `rush install --bypass-policy`.)_
